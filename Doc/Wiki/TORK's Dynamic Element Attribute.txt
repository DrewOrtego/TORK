### Introduction
The [```help```](https://github.com/DrewOrtego/TORK/wiki/Commands#help-arbitrary_parameter-choose-one-browser-general-assertion-page-window-or-all) command can be super useful for test writers, but it should inform a user of exactly what they need to know at any given time, no more and no less.
Since [```PageObjects```](https://github.com/DrewOrtego/TORK/tree/master/PageObjects) can have hundreds of commands-- some of which are not always visible-- how does the harness report only those commands which are relevant?

The answer: the PageObject's ```dynamic_elements``` attribute.

In the simplest case, the ```dynamic_elements``` dictionary contains key-value pairs of file names and XPath expressions.
Anytime a command is executed, the framework checks to see if any of the XPath expressions yield a visible element.
If all the XPath expressions in a value-list are visible, then the commands in the associated file are made available.

There are some very strict requirements to get this feature to work, and understanding how this was written takes a little practice.
This wiki article will guide you through the process of writing the ```dynamic_elements``` attribute, including a few tricks you can leverage to speed up the coding process.

### The Basics
When you write a new PageObject, you need to include the ```dynamic_elements``` attribute. This will always start as ```None```, like this:

```python
self.dynamic_elements = None
```

When you're ready to start making it do something, it will be a dictionary. It will resemble this format throughout it's development:


```
self.dynamic_elements = {
    <str: file path>: <str: XPath expression>,
    <str: file path2>: <str: XPath expression2>,
    etc.
}
```

Notice that the keys and values have some very specific use cases.
The key is a path to a file, or to be more specific, a module.
The value is an XPath expression, and can sometimes be more than one.

When the harness receives a command, the current PageObject's ```dynamic_elements``` is checked to see if it is a dict or None.
If it's a dict, Selenium checks each XPath expression (the dict's values) for visibility.

> This might seem like a time consuming operation, but there are ways to reduce the number of expressions contained in the values.
Also, the implicit-wait time of driver is set to 0 during this operation.
This speeds up the look-up time required to iterate through all the XPath expressions.

If all of the expressions yield visible results, then the file path found in the key imports a Python module.

Here's a simple example of that:

```python
self.dynamic_elements = {
    "UI_CommandFile": '//div[@id="some_unique_id"]'
}
```

In this example, if the specified ```<div>``` element is visible, then all the commands from ```UI_SomeCommands.py``` are made available to the user _until_ that element is no longer visible.

### Dynamic File-Naming
As previously mentioned, this functionality can really slow things down if it is heavily relied upon.
Despite the harness doing a few things to speed things up (e.g. setting the webdriver's implicit wait time to 0 seconds) it will inevitably slow down if many XPath expressions are found in the ```dynamic_elements``` value's.
Fortunately, there's a slick way to avoid that issue.

You can put many modules into a single folder, and use the key-formatting trick to identify only files in that folder.
This lets you control when the framework searches for a module, and tells the framework which _single_ file to grab from a folder.
Let's alter the previous example a little bit and demonstrate this.

```python
self.dynamic_elements = {
    "PageObjectName\\UI_{0}": ['//div[@id="some_unique_id"]']
}
```

What changed? Two things:
1. The key now has a double backslash and [Python's format](https://pyformat.info/) syntax within it.
This tells the harness that the file-of-interest is within the _PageObjectName_ folder, which itself is a subfolder inside the [Commands](https://github.com/DrewOrtego/TORK/tree/master/Commands) directory.
Note that this subfolder is named after a Page Object file found in the [PageObjects directory](https://github.com/DrewOrtego/TORK/tree/master/PageObjects).
This tells the framework to search that folder only if it's name matches the current-page name.
2. The value is now a list, containing the string we saw earlier.
Note that the list has a single object.
Since Python is a zero-indexing language, that means the value's expression is located at index 0 of the list.
Since the key has Python's format-syntax as a suffix to the file name, the harness recognizes this to mean that it should fill ```{0}``` with the text attribute of the expression's result.
This means that the XPath expression will have a result when we call ```.text``` on it.
If the XPath expression fails to return a value from Selenium's ```.text``` attribute, it will fail to find the file to import.

Here's another example:

```python
self.dynamic_elements = {
    '{0}\\UI_{1}': [
        '{}//nav[@class="breadcrumbs" and @data-dojo-attach-point="_analysisModeLblNode"]//a[contains(text(), "Standard Tools")]'.format(self.visible_pane),
        '{}//nav[@class="breadcrumbs" and @data-dojo-attach-point="_analysisModeLblNode"]//a[2]'.format(self.visible_pane)
    ],
}
```

In this example we see two expressions in the value-list: one for the "Standard Tools" header, and second which gets the name of a "visible_pane" element.
Note that the key uses both the first and second indexes in the value-list to build a complete file path.

This example is used in the framework's WebMap PageObject.
Opening an Analysis Tool means that the tool's pane will be visible.
The header of that pane contains two strings which we want to build our file path with: the category of the tool (i.e. Standard, Raster, etc.), and the name of the tool.
Designing the file-structure around these two elements means we can run two XPath expressions to obtain info about which tool is currently open.
This lets us identify over 40 unique tools using just two XPath expressions, as opposed to using 40-80 XPath expressions to identify each one individually.
That's Python jiu jitsu!

Also note that the "UI_" prefix is affixed to the module name.
That ensures that the key in dict is unique, which is important if you use this trick a lot.


#### Module Naming
Since module names cannot contain spaces, the harness will automatically strip out the spaces of a module name before it attempts to import that module.
It is __assumed__ that the key incorporates the module name, either by itself or within a file path, so if you're seeing a lot of SyntaxError's popping up, you probably need to remove spaces from the module name.
