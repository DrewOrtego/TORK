# Parameter Types
Most commands require one or more parameters.
Throughout this article you will find those parameters listed with their corresponding functions.
There are a few different types of parameters, so refer to this section to understand what each function expects.

### String
Any combination of characters within a pair of double quotes.

These are typically used to fill out text elements in the UI such as login credentials or search boxes.

```
fill layer-name "GPT_Ash1"
```

<br>

### Page Element
Any available command which corresponds to an element on the page.

You can check the ```help "page"``` output for available commands to verify whether a page element is available or not.

```
click signin
```

<br>

### Integer
Any valid integer.

```
sleep 42
```

<br>

### Default Parameter
These are commands which are used as parameters to another command.

No special punctuation is needed.

These are always optional, thus not required to get full usage of the framework.

```
help assertion
```

<br>

***

# General Commands
These commands affect the framework, and not the browser.

<br>

### arg_[x]
Available in Automated Mode only.

Assigns any strings provided in the ```args``` list from ```main.py``` to its respective ```arg_x``` command, where x is the position in the list

<br>

```
fill username arg_0
fill password arg_1
```

<br>

### end_save
Ends a save session, if a save session is currently active.

<br>

```
end_save
```

<br>

### help (_default_ [see list of options])
Prints a list of available commands.
Excellent resource when writing test files using Interactive Mode.

<br>

#### Parameter Options (choose one):
* browser -- commands which can manipulate elements in the broswer (e.g. ```click```)
* general -- commands for interacting with the framework. Typically used in Interactive Mode. These do not affect the browser.
* assertion -- assertion commands for verifying true/false properties the current page.
* page -- elements in the current page. Includes the results of "window".
* window -- elements in the current page which are not necessarily always visible. These are usually the elements which are visible after opening a drop-down menu or a pane.

<br>

#### Usage:
* ```help``` no parameter specified; prints all available commands.
* ```help page``` parameter specified; prints all the available page and window commands. Note: it is not an string command.

<br>

### pause
Stops the framework until the user presses the ENTER key.

Useful for debugging in Automated Mode when you want to pause a test file to interact with the browser via peripheral devices.

Can sometimes have unintended behavior in different IDE's.

<br>

```
pause
```

<br>

### prompt (_string_)
Replaces the current prompt string with the provided parameter.

Strips any spaces before or after the non-space characters in the string parameter.

Really encapsulates that text-based game experience!

<br>

```
prompt "><}}}*>"
```

<br>

### rerun (_string_)
Clicks the "Rerun Analysis" (henceforth RA) button for a layer in the content pane.

The string parameter must be a case-insensitive match for the name of the layer whose RA button will be clicked.

The RA button does not need to be visible for this command to work; the underlying function will perform a "hover" action on the layer to make it visible.

<br>

```
rerun "join_features_test123"
```

<br>

### save (_string_)
Begins a save session, which will write any valid and successfully executed commands to the specified file.

Used for assisting in the creation of test files which can be used in an Automated Session.

<br>

```
save "testFile"
```

<br>

### sleep (_integer_)
Tells the framework to wait for n-number of seconds before executing the next command.

Works well when clicking navigational buttons which need to open/render a new page.

The framework has some built-in sleep-type commands, but these are not reliable for _all_ workflows.

You might find that you do not need ```sleep``` in some cases, so experiment with your test files and remember that you can never get too much sleep.

If you wish to stop the framework for an indefinite amount of time, use ```pause```.

<br>

```
sleep 42
```

<br>

### try_start
Starts "try mode" which will ignore any exceptions thrown during the execution of subsequent commands.

Commands will throw exceptions again after the ```try_stop``` command.

<br>

The purpose of this is to allow test files (used in [Automated Mode](https://github.com/DrewOrtego/TORK/wiki/Testing-Modes#automated-mode)) to work for multiple test sites which do not share the same work flows.

<br>

For example, if Site A contains an additional login page, any of Site A's test files will need to include instructions to complete the additional login.

Those instructions might not work for Site B.

Therefore, the test file can utilize ```try_start``` and ```try_stop``` to ensure that Site A's signin work flow will not throw an exception when it runs on Site B.

<br>

```
try_start
click signin
try_stop
```

<br>

### try_stop
Stops "try mode" after it has been started using the ```try_start``` command.

This will then halt a test file normally whenever an exception is thrown.

<br>

```
try_start
click signin
try_stop
```

<br>

### quit
Quits the program.

<br>

```
quit
```

<br>

***

# Page Commands

<br>

### back
Emulates the "back" button in a browser.

Selenium has a caveat for this which basically says that it might not work properly for all browsers.

<br>

```
back
```

<br>

### clear (_page_element_)
Clears the content of the page element, typically used with a text element.

<br>

```
clear some-text-box
```
<br>

### click (_page_element_)
Emulates a mouse left-click on the page element.

<br>

```
click ok
```

<br>

### check_item (_page_element_, _string_)
Checks an element within a collection of checkboxes.

When the text-pattern of the element matches the (case-insensitive) string-parameter, the corresponding checkbox is clicked.

Repeating the command will uncheck the checkbox.

<br>

```
check_item analysis_fields "color"
```

<br>

### double_click_map
Performs a double-click action on the center of the web map.

Only works on the WebMap page.

<br>

```
double_click_map
```

<br>

### fill (_page element_, _string_)
Sends the string contained inside the string command to the page element.

Often used for filling in username and password text fields, or search bars.

<br>

```
fill username "admin"
```

<br>

### fill_unique (_page element_, _string_prefix_ [default=""], _string_variable_ [default=""])
Same as ```fill``` but instead creates a unique string in addition to a provided _string_prefix_.

Unlike ```fill```, the string_prefix parameter is optional, and a unique string is automatically sent to the page element.
Any string provided when you use this command acts as a prefix to whatever unique string is generated by the framework.

In Interactive Mode, if you find that the generated string is _not_ unique, I recommend using the ```clear``` command on the page-element, the use ```fill_unique``` again.

In Automated Mode, if you find that the generated string is _not_ unique, try using it more than once on the same page-element.

<br>

This example will send a unique, nonsensical string to the "result_name" page element, resulting in something like "Q2E3R4"
```
fill_unique result_name
```
***
This example will do the same thing, but will prefix the unique string with the provided text, resulting in something like "SomeOutputE93KF0"
```
fill_unique result_name "SomeOutput"
```
***
Last, we'll create a unique string and save it to a variable to be used in another command:
```
fill_unique result_name "SomeOutput" "unique_str"
```
or, to skip the prefix but still generate a variable...
```
fill_unique result_name "" "unique_str"
```

This will allow the "unique_str" command to be used as such:
```
fill textbox unique_str
```

This is useful when a textbox will only behave correctly when it contains a unique string, and you need that string later in the test.

The unique string does not persist beyond a new test session, thus any variables created are not recognized by different test files.

Avoid using existing command names for the unique variable: the unique variable will essentially overwrite existing commands.
<br>

### enter (_page element_)
Sends the <ENTER> key to an element.

Sometimes this is more effective than using ```submit```.

<br>

```
enter submit
```

<br>

### id (_page element_)
Flashes the page element yellow for ~2 seconds.

Helps with identifying which element is associated with a page command.

<br>

```id username```

<br>

### refresh
Refreshes the current page in the browser.

<br>

```refresh```

<br>

### select_item (_page element_, _string_)
Clicks on an element-- within the provided page element-- whose text property matches that of the string command.

<br>

```select_item drop_down_menu "item one"```

<br>

### single_click_map
Performs a single-click action on the center of the web map.

Only works on the WebMap page.

<br>

```
single_click_map
```

<br>

### submit (_page element_)
Runs selenium's ```submit``` function on a page element. Using ```enter``` is sometimes preferable if this doesn't work.

<br>

```
submit search-for-layers
```

<br>

# Assertion Commands

<br>

### assert_clickable (_page element_, _integer_ [default=5])
Verify whether the page element is clickable within the given number of seconds.

Includes an optional feature wherein it will attempt the assert action for the provided number of seconds before passing or failing the assertion.
(Five seconds is used if no _integer_ parameter is provided)

<br>

```
assert_clickable signin 10
```

<br>

### assert_credits_required (_text_, _integer_ [default=5])
Verify that the credit estimator is properly reporting the number of credits required.

The required _text_ parameter should contain the expected _number_ in the pop-up.

<br>

```
assert_credits_required "0.0042"
```

<br>

### assert_contains (_page element_, _text_, _integer_ [default=5])
Verify that the _page element_ contains a sub-element whose text property matches the _text_ pattern.

<br>

```
assert_contains table-of-contents "GPT Ash1 - Points layer" 2
```

<br>

### assert_in_toc (_string_)
Verify that the page element is visible within the table of content on the Web Map page.

<br>

assert_in_toc "GPT Ash1 - Polyons"
```

<br>

### assert_not_contains (_page element_, _text_, _integer_ [default=5])
Verify that the _page element_ does not contain a sub-element whose text property matches the _text_ pattern (five seconds is used if no _integer_ parameter is provided).

<br>

```
assert_not_contains parameter_one "Lines layer" 2
```

<br>

### assert_text (_page element_, _string_, _integer_ [default=5])
Verify that the page element's text property matches the provided string (five seconds is used if no _integer_ parameter is provided).

<br>

```
assert_title "Red Room" 12
```

<br>

### assert_total_records (_text_, _integer_ [default=5])
Verify that the credit estimator is properly reporting the number of records found for processing.

The required _text_ parameter should contain the expected _number_ in the pop-up.

<br>

```
assert_total_records "42"
```

<br>

### assert_visible (_page element_, _integer_ [default=5])
